## Sol Sector

We want to build a play-to-enjoy game on the Solana blockchain. We are inspired by attractive classic space trading games as Elite. We also want to keep the classic-game feeling, with simple graphics, isometric projections and internal mini-games.
We intend to be an interesting, attractive adventure, trying to engage the user's imagination, and becoming an enjoyable game, but more in the sense of an enjoyable book keeping simple graphics and engaging the user's imagination, and not try to be a full visual 3d game, something we associate with “movies”. We intend to be a very interesting book adventure, not a movie.
We focused on designing the story and a simple web-based user interface. We intend to use Solana programs to manage every planet’s market, the basic elements as SPL-tokens, use NFTs for renting equipment, facilities and spacecraft, and also sell/buy the same game elements as NFTs
We are motivated to do a type of game that is “play to enjoy and earn”, not only play to ear, that ends up being boring, turning out into gaming bubbles in which people play the trending game until a more profitable one appears.
If the game in which you invest so many hours a day has its own currency there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to take profit from it.
After all, time is money.
During the hackathon we were able to compose a multidisciplinary team that complemented each other perfectly to develop the project.
We devise a game of strategy, commerce, adventure, that will catch you.
Vote for us and let's develop this project together.
Let 's play.
